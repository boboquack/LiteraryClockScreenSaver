## Data Sources
Source of literary quotes also by *tjaap* from link on https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/ 
-- *litclock_annotated.csv*. So far, I've made some minor tweaks to this data to get each quote onto one line. Oddly, this is a pipe separated file, not comma separated as the name might imply.
