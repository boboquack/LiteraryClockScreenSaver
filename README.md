# LiteraryClockScreenSaver
MacOS screen saver to display time via literary quotes. Based on way cooler 
https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/ written by

*This is a WIP; pretty raw so far.*

Source of literary quotes also by *tjaap* from link on https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/ 
-- *litclock_annotated.csv*. So far, I've made some minor tweaks to this data to get each quote onto one line. Oddly, this is a 
pipe separated file, not comma separated as the name might imply. I couldn't find any licensing information on the source site
so I'm assuming this is public domain.
